# Microsoft Azure Arc Webinar Series with QA & Microsoft 

**Azure Arc** is a bridge that extends the Azure platform to help you build applications and services with the flexibility to run across data centers, at the edge, and in multi-cloud environments. Develop cloud-native applications with a consistent development, operations, and security model. Azure Arc runs on both new and existing hardware, virtualization and Kubernetes platforms, IoT devices, and integrated systems. Do more with less by leveraging your existing investments to modernize with cloud-native solutions.
